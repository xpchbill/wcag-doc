## Common Issue - [ANE-137868](https://jirafnd.dev.activenetwork.com/browse/ANE-137868)
- Issue

> The page titles for all pages fail to adequately describe the page content stating only “Online Services”.

- Recommendation

> Ensure that the page title conveys the primary topic of the page as well as the site name (e.g., “Home - Online Services | City of Ottawa”).


```{.js code-line-numbers="3,17"}
// xxxRoute.js
pageHeaderOptions: {
  tabName: pageTitle
},
// Master.js
componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
  this.syncDocumentTitle();
}
syncDocumentTitle = () => {
  const { configurations } = this.context;
  const route = this.getCurrentRoute();
  if (route) {
    const { pageHeaderOptions = {} } = route;
    const pageTitle = pageHeaderOptions.tabName || pageHeaderOptions.title;
    const tabWording = configurations.get('public_url_tab_wording');
    const finalTabName = combineTabName(pageTitle, tabWording);
    document.title = finalTabName;
  }
}
```

- Issue

> The timeouts fail to offer the extension of time required by this success criterion.

- Recommendation

> Provide users with the opportunity to extend the timeout duration by up to ten times the original amount.

## Common Issue - [ANE-138518](https://jirafnd.dev.activenetwork.com/browse/ANE-138518) {.smaller}
- Issue

> Throughout the application, multiple expandable regions are given aria-labels that are too verbose and obscure the description of the actual control with information that is not needed (e.g., “Section Activity selection collapse detail clickable arrow”)

- Recommendation

> Change the aria-label wordings to be more precise about the controls they represent and leave out information that is not required to understand the control (e.g., “Activity selection”). Additional attributes already provide many of the queues required for assistive technologies to understand the control such as aria-expanded indicating expanded or collapsed.

### Solution
- Remove unnecessary words from aria-label.
- Use aria-expanded + aria-own/aria-controls to describe the expand/collapse state and related origin.
- More details please confirm with UX about the special cases.
